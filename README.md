# UCLA-Project1 - AwesomeDash

<hr>

This was the first Project that my team and I created while attendting the UCLA Extension bootcamp.  This project is called AwesomeDash it utlizes Firebase Auth and has many custom functions built into the user as they sign in.  The user zipcode is passed to the webpage and it API pulls relevant weather based on the geographical location of the user.  The location can be changed in the account page.  If we had further development time I would continue to add API calls to the webpage and create many more functions.

Right now the userdata is all stored in a firebase DB.  The users DB entry is created off of the unique ID assigned to the uder based on the OAuth ID that is passed back from the user signing in.

This was a 2 week project and was a lot of fun to do!
